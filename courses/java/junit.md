## *Testing* definition
*Dynamic verification that the program has the expected behavior in a suitably selected final set of test cases*
* Unit testing
* Integration testing
* System testing


## *Unit testing* definition
*Unit testing is a method of testing individual units of source code to determine if they are fit for use*
* Is performed at the development phase of a software’s life cycle
* Detects problems early in the development process
* Unit tests should be independent from one other
* External dependencies should be removed
* Unit tests are the smallest testable parts of an application
* Simplifies Integration
* Not suitable for testing user interface components


## Test plan
* //TODO recreate the graph from the powerpoint slide 5


## Test class
* Define test classes and therein implement test methods (known also as “test cases”) 
* Good practices: 
 * Each class should have its corresponding test class
 * Test classes should have the same name as the functional class with an additional **Test\*** prefix
 * Example:
     - Functional class : MyMathSimple
     - Test class : TestMyMathSimple


## Test class (2)     
 * Test classes should follow the same package structure with the functional classes
* //TODO picture from powepoint slide 6


## A simple example
* **MyMathSimple** : a class with a simple/single method located in the package (main)
// TODO
