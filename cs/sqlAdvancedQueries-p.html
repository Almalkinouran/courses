## Advances queries


## SQL HAVING clause
A HAVING clause specifies that an SQL SELECT statement should only return rows where aggregate values meet the specified conditions. 
It was added to the SQL language because the WHERE keyword could not be used with aggregate functions
Remember, WHERE for conditions before grouping, HAVING for conditions after grouping.
Syntax:
```sql
SELECT column_name, aggregate_function(column_name)
FROM table_name
WHERE column_name operator value
GROUP BY column_name
HAVING aggregate_function(column_name) operator value; 
```


## SQL HAVING clause example
```sql
-- Which UK customers have payed more than 1000$ in a year for the years 1997 and 1998?
SELECT C.CompanyName AS [Company Name], 
		YEAR(O.OrderDate) AS [Year of Order], 
		SUM( OD.Quantity ) AS [Total Quantity], 
		SUM( OD.Quantity * OD.UnitPrice ) AS [Total Revenues]
FROM Customers AS C
	INNER JOIN Orders AS O ON C.CustomerID = O.CustomerID
	INNER JOIN [Order Details] AS OD ON O.OrderID = OD.OrderID
WHERE C.Country = 'UK'
    AND YEAR(O.OrderDate) IN (1997, 1998)
GROUP BY C.CompanyName, YEAR(O.OrderDate)
HAVING SUM( OD.Quantity * OD.UnitPrice ) > 1000
ORDER BY C.CompanyName, YEAR(O.OrderDate);
```


## SQL Variables
Object that holds a single data value of a specified type
Uses:
* Holds data for later use
* Counters
* As inputs or outputs to stored procedures, functions

Syntax:
```sql
DECLARE <@var_nam> <data_type>
```


## SQL Variables examples
```sql
DECLARE @i int;
DECLARE @stringVar VARCHAR(200);
DECLARE @myDate DATETIME;
```


## SQL Variables Assigning Values
### SET
Used to set a value to a scalar (not table) variable 
Syntax:
```sql
DECLARE <@var_nam> <data_type>;
SET <@var_nam> = value;
```
Example:
```sql
DECLARE @i INT;
SET @i = 10;
SET @stringVar = 'Coding Bootcamp';
```


### SELECT 
* Used to set a value to a scalar variable
* Can be also used for setting values to multiple variables at once
Syntax:
```sql
SELECT @i = 1, 
       @stringVar = 'Coding Bootcamp';
       @myDate = '2016-10-24'
```


## SET vs SELECT for setting values to variables
* SET is the ANSI standard for variable assignment, SELECT is not
* SET can only assign one variable at a time, SELECT can make multiple assignments at once
* If assigning from a query, SET can only assign a scalar value. If the query returns multiple values/rows then SET will raise an error. 
    SELECT will assign one of the values to the variable and hide the fact that multiple values were returned 
* When assigning from a query if there is no value returned then SET will assign NULL, where SELECT will not make the assignment at all (so the variable will not be changed from its previous value)
* As far as speed differences - there are no direct differences between SET and SELECT. However SELECT's ability to make multiple assignments in one shot does give it a slight speed advantage over SET.


## Temporary tables
Can be used as a workspace for intermediate results
They can be
* Local temporary tables (starting with #)
* Global temporary tables (starting with ##)
* Table variables (starting with @)
* Other (not in our lesson's scope)


## TABLE Variables
* Used in the scope of the routine or batch within they are defined
* Cause less recompiles
* Not affected by rollbacks

Syntax example:
```sql
DECLARE @myStudents TABLE
		(ID int, 
		LastName VARCHAR(50), 
		FirstName VARCHAR(50)
		);
```


## Temporary tables
* Support every single feature a database table can feature
* Can be altered after creation
* Can have multiple indexes
* Can be used with Dynamic SQL
* Can be local (#) or global (##)

Syntax example:
```sql
CREATE TABLE #myStudents 
		(ID int, 
		LastName VARCHAR(50), 
		FirstName VARCHAR(50)
		);
```


## SQL IN Operator
The IN operator allows you to specify multiple values in a WHERE clause.
Syntax:
```sql
SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table_name
WHERE column_name IN (value1,value2,...);
```


## SQL IN Operator example
```sql
-- How many objects has each customer from Canada, UK and USA ordered each year?
SELECT C.CompanyName, C.Country, YEAR(O.OrderDate) AS [Year], SUM( OD.Quantity ) [Total Quantity]
FROM Customers C
	INNER JOIN Orders O ON C.CustomerID = O.CustomerID
	INNER JOIN [Order Details] OD ON O.OrderID = OD.OrderID
WHERE C.Country IN ('UK', 'USA', 'Canada')
GROUP BY C.CompanyName, YEAR(O.OrderDate), C.Country
ORDER BY C.CompanyName, YEAR(O.OrderDate);
```


## Subqueries
Queries embedded in queries.
Example:
```sql
-- Find the name of the company that placed order 10290.
SELECT CompanyName
FROM Customers
WHERE CustomerID = (SELECT CustomerID
			FROM Orders
			WHERE OrderID = 10290);
```
Better example why to use a subquery:
Example:
```sql
-- Find the Companies that placed orders in 1997
SELECT CompanyName
FROM Customers
WHERE CustomerID IN (SELECT CustomerID
			FROM Orders
			WHERE OrderDate BETWEEN '1997-01-01' AND '1997-12-31');
```


## Tips and Tricks for the excersises
* Use aliases for table names (e.g. SELECT C.CompanyName FROM Customers AS C)
* Use DISTINCT for distinct results (for checking purposes)
* BEGIN TRANSACTION ... ROLLBACK from INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE commands
* Use @@ROWCOUNT to check number of affected rows 
* Always use WHERE clause for DELETE and UPDATE commands
* Try to never use CURSORS and WHILE loops 
* Prefer table variables to temporary tables
